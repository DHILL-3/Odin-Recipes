    <h2>How does pinecone jelly taste?</h2>
    <p>
        The finished pinecone jam is like an herbal honey, with a slightly resinous finish. The exact flavor varies with the species used, cooking time, and growing conditions for the cones.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds of small green cones</li>
        <li>3 pounds of cane sugar (preferably organic)</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse any debris off your cones, and then put them in a large pot with the sugar and water. Put the pot on the stove, stir until the sugar is dissolved, and bring to a boil. Cook at a moderate boil for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and allow to cool.</li>
        <li>At this point, the liquid with be somewhat grey in color, and the cones will start to darken. Let the mixture cool completely before starting the next round of cooking.</li>
        <li>Once the mixture is cool, put it back on the heat and bring to a boil again. Boil for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. As it cooks, the mixture thickens, and the liquid changes color from grey to red-brown. The pinecones turn brown.</li>
        <li>After a half hour, remove the pot from the heat and let it cool again. Once cooled, return it to the stove top one more time. Boil for around 30 minutes, until the syrup is as thick as you like. Remember, once it cools, the syrup will thicken, so it's helpful to do a gelling test.</li>
    </ol>
